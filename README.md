# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project classifies iris flowers into their species: **setosa**, **versicolor**, and **virginica**, based on their features. It demonstrates the application of classification algorithms in identifying patterns within a dataset.

## Key Features
- Preprocesses and cleans the Iris dataset.
- Visualizes data patterns to uncover relationships among features.
- Builds a model to classify iris species with high accuracy (93%).

## Technologies Used
- Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Classification: Scikit-learn

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file to train the model and classify flower species.

## Outputs
- Visualization of the Iris dataset.
- A classification report showing model performance.
